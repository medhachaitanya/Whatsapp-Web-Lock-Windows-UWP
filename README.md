# About Project
This project is a very simple application for protecting your Whatsapp - Desktop with a password.   I am a student and often share my laptop with my friends. There are a lot of instances that I forgot to logout the app on my browser and hitting https://web.whatsapp.com auto logins in to my account if I haven't logged out. I wanted a locking functionality for the Whatsapp desktop app which is missing. So, being a developer, I took a step forward to create the app for myself and share it with you as well. I hope you like it and find it useful.  

# Latest Windows Store App Policy: 10.1.1
Any windows app that is a web app(web based) must be published by the owner of the related domain or website. In my case, the owner is Whatsapp(https://web.whatsapp.com). So, I cannot publish it in the store. However, I am making this app available to be downloaded via Github as this is needed by many of us including my friends.

# The app is free and some of the development is still in progress.
